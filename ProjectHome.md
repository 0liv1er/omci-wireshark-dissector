**OMCI** protocol is the management protocol for fiber networks. It is used to configure Gigabit Passive Optical Network (GPON).

The purpose of the dissector is to decode OMCI data flowing between Optical Line Termination (OLT, the network side) and Optical Network Termination (ONT, the end user side).

OMCI is the management protocol used to configure the services on the ONT (like Ethernet, QoS, Video overlay, Tx/Rx control, bandwidth, etc...).
