==Introduction==
Wireshark dissector for ONT Management and Control Interface (OMCI) protocol (ITU Rec. G984.4)

This protocol is used on Gigabit Passive Optical Network (GPON) between Optical Line Termition (OLT) and Optical Network Termination (ONT) units.

This is management protocol used to configure services (like Ethernet, Video overlay, Tx/RX control) on the ONT.


== Pre-requirements ==
The dissector is working with Wirshark *version 1.4.3* (or newer version). The Lua version should be at least *Lua 5.1*.

 * Go to your Wireshark project directory, on Windoze {{{C:\Program Files\Wireshark}}}
 * Open file {{{init.lua}}}
 * Add the following line at the end of this {{{init.lua}}} file: {{{dofile("C:\\Path\\to\\my\\favourite\\folder\\omci.lua")}}}
 * Download source files from [http://code.google.com/p/omci-wireshark-dissector/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk subversion]
 * Copy both {{{BinDecHex.lua}}} and {{{omci.lua}}} files into Wireshark project directory
